## Explanation
This is my first stab at using Rails 5 and actioncable.  Since there are so many tutorials about using actioncable to create a chat application, I wanted to try something a little different and went with a tic tac toe game.  

In it's current state - the base actioncable feature of the server updating the game view for multiple clients i.e. players - without the need of reloading the screen - works!
