Hi.  

I am working on a chatbot for this section but it isn't done yet.  

If you are on this site its likely you already have my [resume](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/i0j2gpq702i).

So here are some things about me not on my that impressive file above.

I'm married.  I'm from St. Louis.  I have a pet - cat Benatar.  She eats spinach.  I generally do not. 

I read mostly pulpy crime fiction.  I studied poetry writing.  My favorite poet is probably [A.R. Ammons](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/city-limits#).

I play Overwatch, poorly.  I like coding because of the problem-solving involved.  I find the parallels with poetry pretty interesting.
